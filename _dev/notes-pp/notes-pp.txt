spl attacker, moverb and deverb is basically spl transient designer but split into three parts tho
attacker can make the attack envelope of a sample snappier
so if u wanna make kick or snare more punchy u use that
spl deverb to get rid of reverb from snares or want to make a snare shorter or more direct
it removes the tail of the sample
or completely dries out a reverbed snare
if ur unhappy with a snare tail this thing fixes it always
i use it i think all the time on my beat
and moverb is for adding tail
but i never use that tbh if i want a snare to be a lil longer i use a short reverb
its one of the most used plugins of mine for sure
get Plugin Alliance all plugins bundle from torrents
or buy them
they have insane sales i boight 25 plugins from them now i think
get 25 bucks voucher every month now for being loyal
and extra diacounts
and with insane discount i mean a plugin that is 150 i buy for 30 easy
